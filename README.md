# GoTTH

This is a simple demo web application built using Go, Tailwind, Templ, and HTMX, aka the GOTTH stack :sparkles:

More information on this stack and all the tooling used can be found [on this repo](https://github.com/TomDoesTech/GOTTH).

## Start developing

Open 2 terminals and run the following commands in each:

```bash
make tailwind-watch
```

```bash
make dev
```
